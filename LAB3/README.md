## Activity goal

The goal of this laboratory activity is to design a position controller for a DC servomotor driving
a resonant mechanical load. For such purpose, the original inertial load (disc inertia) of the DC
gearmotor available in laboratory is replaced with a rigid beam connected to the motor through a
flexible coupling (elastic joint). The whole setup actually resembles a conventional two–mass system, which is the representative model of practically every motion system with an elastic transmission.
Both the PID and state–space control techniques are taken into account for the design. The state–space design is performed with either conventional eigenvalues placement methods, or by using optimal techniques based on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).

The project will touch:
1. Position PID control with the resonant load
2. Estimation of the elastic joint parameters
3. Position state–space control using LQR methods
